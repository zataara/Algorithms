Write a function called constructNote, which accepts two strings, a message and some letters. The function should return true if the message can be built with the letters that you are given; otherwise, it should return false.

Assume that there are only lowercase letters and no space or special characters in both the message and the letters.

Constraints:

Time Complexity: O(M + N) - If M is the length of message and N is the length of letters:

Examples:
```
constructNote('aa', 'abc') // false
constructNote('abc', 'dcba') // true
constructNote('aabbcc', 'bcabcaddff') // true
```
