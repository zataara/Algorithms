# Bank Account

Write a function called createAccount which creates a bank account given a PIN number and an initial deposit amount. The return value should be an object with four methods on it:

- checkBalance: Given the correct PIN, return the current balance. (If the PIN is invalid, return “Invalid PIN.”)
- deposit: Given the correct PIN and a deposit amount, increment the account balance by the amount. (If the PIN is invalid, return “Invalid PIN.”)
- withdraw: Given the correct PIN and a withdrawal amount, decrement the account balance by the amount. You also shouldn’t be able to withdraw more than you have. (If the PIN is invalid, return “Invalid PIN.”)
- changePin: Given the old PIN and a new PIN, change the PIN number to the new PIN. (If the old PIN is invalid, return “Invalid PIN.”)
```
let account = createAccount("1234", 100);

account.checkBalance("oops");
// "Invalid PIN."

account.deposit("1234", 250);
// "Succesfully deposited $250. Current balance: $350."

account.withdraw("1234" 300);
// "Succesfully withdrew $300. Current balance: $50."

account.withdraw("1234" 10);
// "Withdrawal amount exceeds account balance. Transaction cancelled."

account.changePin("1234", "5678");
// "PIN successfully changed!"
